I'm a software engineer based in Dayton Ohio with a passion for learning about and writing high performance code. Professionally I spend my time writing code for real-time simulations used in training.

As a hobbyist I also have a passion for graphics programming, and enjoy building desktop apps using OpenGL and Vulkan.
